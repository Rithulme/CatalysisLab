Classroom experiments involving catalysis are hard to do. Most tests require alot of time and complex analysis equipment in order to provide a 'realistic' example.

The goal of this project is to make a program where an experiment can be simulated. The tutor can design a reaction to be tested, which is fed in the student-side of the program. The student can then freely modify all sorts of parameters in a catalysis experiment in order to gain insight in the reaction. This would simulate a realistic research project without all the associated problems concerning analysis, catalyst synthesis etc.
